As a Student at Kathmandu Engineering College, I have acquired skills in C, C++ and some others.Currently studying in 3rd year, I always think about what I have missed to learn about this frequently emerging Technological World what other have already learned. So, I always try to search for these type of opportunities where I could gain more practical knowledge working with the professionals. I have other skills and knowledge in Machine Learning,Web Development,Unity  Development,etc. which I have explained in my CV above.I have also done some projects for Django and Python and also participated in Ludum Dare ( Game Development Jam ).I work on Linux Centos Environment in my Laptop, so I am familiar with its terminal, Samba Server, SSH, Apache Server, etc.I am already so excited for this intership.
